Project name: personal resume website

Description: my personal website pages which includes details about me and my resume. This exists more as a proof of concept to myself, to help myself learn the fundementals of html and css, so keep in mind that it is an ameteur first attempt and I am fully aware that it has a lot of room for improvement, and that its probably better that i make those mistakes now and learn from them for later.

problems:
 issues that came up during the creation process include:
 - i did not consider smart phones while designing the website and as a result, the layout of the site is not smart phone browser friendly
 - i did not consider monitor size as a foctor while disgning the website, and as a result the site tends to be unfriendly to monitors on the larger end of the spectrum.
