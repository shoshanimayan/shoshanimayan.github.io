Project name: personal resume website

Description: my personal site pages which includes details about me and my resume. This exists more as a proof of concept to my self, to see how much how much html and css I've retained, so it is an extremly juvenile first attempt and I am aware that it has a lot of room for improvement. please note that the website in its current iteration is not smart phone friendly and should probably be via a computer moniter.
