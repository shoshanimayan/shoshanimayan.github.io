Project name: personal resume website

Description: my personal website pages which includes details about me and my resume. This exists more as a proof of concept to myself, to see how much how much html and css I've retained, so keep in mind that it is an ameteur first attempt and I am fully aware that it has a lot of room for improvement. please note that the website in its current iteration is not smart phone friendly and should probably be seen via a computer moniter.
