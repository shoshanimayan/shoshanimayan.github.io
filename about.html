           <div>
             <p>Hello, I'm Mayan Shoshani, a computer science student, and programmer at The University of California, Irvine. </p>
            <p>After completing my high school Diploma at Santa Clara High School, I began working towards my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UCI. Now, in the second year of my college education, I have begun to seek internships, as well as work and research opportunities to help expand my skill repertoire and increase my work experience.  </p>             
             <p> My passions in both my life and my work are split between my love of technology, and my love of learning and seeing new things. I am always looking to be challenged by new problems and experiences, and I'm not afraid to learn and grow from any mistakes or hardships that may result. I would describe myself as hard working, a quick learner, and enthusiastic to cooperate with others, while also desiring to learn how to solve problems on my own.  </p>
             <p>I constantly strive to balance my work effort between my instincts to be a perfectionist, and my desire to be realistic in the distribution of my effort within the restrictions of time. I think it's important to a do a job right the first time, but I also know that focusing all my effort on one part of the job means the whole will never be complete.</p>
             <p>I am a Northern California, Bay Area native. I am a self proclaimed international traveler, and an enthusiast of film, spicy food, and modern art. I spend my free time playing video games, reading fiction, or learning new cooking recipes. </p>
